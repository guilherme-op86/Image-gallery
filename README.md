This project features a responsive image gallery built with pure HTML and CSS, using Flexbox for fluid layout management. It focuses on clean design, smooth interactivity, and sharp visual details â€” including subtle zoom effects and animated text overlays on hover.
It also applies styling best practices like scalable rem units, modular class structure, and elegant transitions using transform and transition. It's a great showcase of how CSS alone can create rich user experiences without relying on external libraries.
Perfect for anyone interested in minimalist UI/UX design and reusable front-end components.
